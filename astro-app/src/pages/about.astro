			<p>
				Hi, I'm Anton. This is a small practice blog I built to learn and experiment with Sanity CMS
				and a modern content setup.

				<br /><br />
				I'm using this project to play around with content modeling, blog layouts, and publishing workflows,
				while writing occasionally about crypto, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. The focus here is learning and
				experimenting rather than predictions or financial advice.

				<br /><br />
				Outside of building things, I enjoy staying active — gym sessions, cycling, and generally keeping
				a good balance between screens and real life.
			</p>

			<p>
				This blog is a place to track my progress as a developer while learning more about crypto
				and decentralized technologies along the way.
			</p>
